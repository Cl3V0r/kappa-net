This project formed my Bachelor Thesis at TU Dortmund 2018 that was conducted under the supervision of Jan Kierfeld and is here republished using more modern libraries.

# Inferring Polymer Bending Stiffness with Neural Networks

This project combines **Monte Carlo simulations** of semiflexible polymers with **deep learning regression** to predict the bending stiffness Îº from angular configurations.

## ðŸ§  Overview
- **Simulation:** Metropolis Monte Carlo of a polymer with bending energy `E = (Îº/2) Î£ (Î”Î¸)^2`
- **Goal:** Predict Îº from sampled angular configurations using a neural network
- **Tech Stack:** C++17 (simulation) + TensorFlow 2 (ML) + Python 3.11

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Run simulation
```bash
cd src
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o simulate
./simulate

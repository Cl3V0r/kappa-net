This project formed my Bachelor Thesis at TU Dortmund 2018 that was conducted under the supervision of Jan Kierfeld and is here republished using more modern libraries.

# Inferring Polymer Bending Stiffness with Neural Networks

This project combines **Monte Carlo simulations** of semiflexible polymers with **deep learning regression** to predict the bending stiffness κ from angular configurations.

## Overview
- **Simulation:** Metropolis Monte Carlo of a polymer with bending energy `E = (κ/2) Σ (Δθ)^2`
- **Goal:** Predict κ from sampled angular configurations using a neural network
- **Tech Stack:** C++17 (simulation) + PyTorch (ML) + Python 3.11

## Quick Start

### 0. Run simulation
```bash
mkdir build && cd build  
cmake ..
make -j
cd .. 
./build/polymer_sim

### 1. Train model
python model/train.py
